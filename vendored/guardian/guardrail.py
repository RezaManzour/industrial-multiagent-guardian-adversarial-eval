"""
Rule-based Guardrail layer for the Industrial Multi-Agent Guardian project.

Design principle (core to this whole project):
This module contains NO LLM calls whatsoever. Every decision here is
deterministic Python logic, testable in isolation, and fully explainable.
This is the ONLY place in the system authorized to approve or reject
an allocation. Planner/Resource agents (src/graph.py) only propose;
this module decides.

Rules enforced (in order; first violated rule determines rejection):
  1. order_id must reference a real order in the current state
  2. machine_id must reference a real machine in the current state
  3. start_hour must be >= 0 and strictly less than end_hour
  4. the allocated duration must cover the order's required processing
     time on that machine (no under-allocating time)
  5. end_hour must not exceed the order's deadline_hour
  6. the allocation must not exceed the machine's capacity at any
     overlapping time slot (checked against already-approved allocations)
