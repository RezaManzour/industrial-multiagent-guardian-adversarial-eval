LangGraph orchestration for the Industrial Multi-Agent Guardian project.

Design principle:
The agents defined here (Planner, Resource) may PROPOSE allocations using
LLM reasoning, but they NEVER make the final accept/reject decision.
That authority belongs exclusively to the rule-based Guardrail layer
(src/guardrail.py, to be added in a later phase). This file only wires
together the "planning/narration" side of the system.
